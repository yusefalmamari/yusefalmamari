# **Āyat al-Kursī (The Throne Verse)**

**“Allāh – there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining. Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth. Who is it that can intercede with Him except by His permission? He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them, and they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills. His Kursī extends over the heavens and the earth, and their preservation tires Him not. And He is the Most High, the Most Great.”** [al-Baqarah: 255]

This is **Āyat al-Kursī**, and it holds a great status. It has been authentically reported from the Messenger of Allāh (peace be upon him) that it is the greatest verse in the Book of Allāh.

Imām Aḥmad reported:

> ʿAbd ar-Razzāq narrated to us, from Sufyān, from Saʿīd al-Jurayrī, from Abū as-Silil, from ʿAbdullāh ibn Rabāḥ, from Ubayy (who is Ubayy ibn Kaʿb), that the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked him, “Which verse in the Book of Allāh is the greatest?”
>
> Ubayy replied, “Allāh and His Messenger know best.”
>
> The Prophet (peace be upon him) repeated the question several times [^1], and then Ubayy answered, “Āyat al-Kursī.”
>
> The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, **“Rejoice in your knowledge, O Abū Mundhir! By the One in Whose hand is my soul, it has a tongue and lips that glorify the King at the foot of the Throne.”** [^2]

Muslim also reported this narration through Abū Bakr ibn Abī Shaybah, from ʿAbd al-Aʿlā ibn ʿAbd al-Aʿlā, from al-Jurayrī, with the same chain, but without the additional statement: **“By the One in Whose hand is my soul…”** [^3]

## **The Wisdom of Āyat al-Kursī and Its Profound Meanings**

The verse contains ten independent statements, and each carries profound theological meanings.

**“Allāh – there is no deity except Him”** — Affirmation of His sole divinity, with none deserving worship but Him.

**“the Ever-Living, the Self-Sustaining”** — He is eternally alive, whose life is perfect and everlasting, and He sustains and maintains all of creation. It’s noted that ʿUmar used to recite “al-Qayyūm” (Self-Sustaining) as “al-Qayyām” [^4]. All creation is dependent upon Him while He is self-sufficient, sustaining everything by His command, as stated in: **“And of His signs is that the heaven and earth stand [i.e., remain] by His command”** [Ar-Rūm: 25].

**“Neither drowsiness overtakes Him nor sleep”** — He is not affected by any deficiency, heedlessness, or distraction from His creation. Rather, He is ever-watchful over every soul for what it earns—a witness over all things. Nothing is hidden from Him, nor is anything concealed from His knowledge. As part of His perfect self-sustaining authority (_Qayyūmiyyah_), He is not overtaken by drowsiness or sleep. His saying **‘Neither drowsiness overtakes Him’** means that drowsiness (the initial stage of sleepiness or light slumber) does not overpower Him. That is why He then said **‘nor sleep,’** because sleep is a stronger and deeper state than drowsiness.

In the authentic narration, from Abū Mūsā, he said:

> The Messenger of Allāh (peace be upon him) stood among us and said four statements, **“Indeed, Allāh does not sleep, nor is it befitting for Him to sleep. He lowers the scales of justice and raises them. The deeds of the day are presented to Him before the deeds of the night, and the deeds of the night before the deeds of the day. His veil is light (or fire); if He were to unveil it, the radiance of His Face would burn everything His sight reaches from His creation.”** [^5]

**“To Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and whatever is on the earth.”** — Everything is under His dominion and control, His slaves and under His command, as echoed in, **“There is no one in the heavens and earth but that he comes to the Most Merciful as a servant. He has enumerated them and counted them a [full] counting. And all of them are coming to Him on the Day of Resurrection alone.”** [Maryam: 93–95]. And, **“And how many angels there are in the heavens whose intercession will not avail at all except [only] after Allāh has permitted [it] to whom He wills and approves.”** [An-Najm: 26]. And, **“and they cannot intercede except on behalf of one whom He approves.”** [al-Anbiyāʾ: 28].

Demonstrating His supreme authority and majesty—Exalted and Glorified is He—none can intercede unless He grants permission, as mentioned in the ḥadīth of Intercession, **“I will come under the Throne and fall in prostration. Allāh will leave me there as long as He wills. Then it will be said, _‘Raise your head, speak and you will be heard, ask and you will be given, intercede and your intercession will be accepted.’_ Then He will set a limit for me, and I will admit them into Paradise.”** [^6]

**“He knows what is [presently] before them and what will be after them.”** — Allāh’s knowledge encompasses all things, past, present, and future. This is similar to His words regarding the angels, **“[Jibrīl said], ‘And we [angels] descend not except by the order of your Lord. To Him belongs that before us and that behind us and what is in between. And never is your Lord forgetful.’”** [Maryam: 64].

**“And they encompass not a thing of His knowledge except for what He wills.”** — No one has knowledge of anything of His knowledge except what He Allāh, the Almighty, has taught them and informed them of. It is also possible that the intended meaning is that they cannot comprehend anything of the knowledge of His Ḏāt and Attributes, except what Allāh has made known to them—just as He says, **“But they do not encompass it [i.e., what He knows] in knowledge.”** [Ṭā Hā: 110]

**“His Kursī Extends Over the Heavens and the Earth”** — Ibn Abī Ḥātim said:

> Abū Saʿīd al-Ashajj narrated to us, from Muṭarrif ibn Ṭarīf, from Jaʿfar ibn Abī al-Mughīrah, from Saʿīd ibn Jubayr, from Ibn ʿAbbās regarding Allāh’s statement, **“His Kursī extends over the heavens and the earth.”** He said, “It refers to His knowledge.”

Similarly, Ibn Jarīr narrated this from ʿAbdullāh ibn Idrīs and Hushaym, both from Muṭarrif ibn Ṭarīf with the same chain. Ibn Abī Ḥātim also reported from Saʿīd ibn Jubayr a similar interpretation. [^7]

Then Ibn Jarīr said, “Others have said that the Kursī is the footstool.” He narrated this from Abū Mūsā, al-Suddī, al-Ḍaḥḥāk, and Muslim al-Baṭīn. [^8]

Shujaʿ ibn Mukhlad, in his _Tafsīr_, said:

> Abū ʿĀṣim narrated to us from Sufyān, from ʿAmmār al-Duhnī, from Muslim al-Baṭīn, from Saʿīd ibn Jubayr, from Ibn ʿAbbās, who said, “The Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about Allāh’s statement: **‘His Kursī extends over the heavens and the earth.’**
>
> He replied, **‘His Kursī is the place of His feet, and none can estimate the greatness of the Throne except Allāh, the Almighty.’**”

This ḥadīth was also mentioned by the scholar Abū Bakr ibn Mardawayh through the chain of Shujaʿ ibn Mukhlad al-Fallās, though it contains an error. [^9]

This narration was also reported by Wakiʿ in his _Tafsīr_:

> Sufyān narrated to us, from ʿAmmār al-Duhnī, from Muslim al-Baṭīn, from Saʿīd ibn Jubayr, from Ibn ʿAbbās, who said, “The Kursī is the place of the feet, and no one can estimate the greatness of the Throne.” [^10]

It was also narrated by al-Ḥākim in his _al-Mustadrak_ from Abū al-ʿAbbās Muḥammad ibn Aḥmad al-Maḥbūbī, from Muḥammad ibn Muʿādh, from Abū ʿĀṣim, from Sufyān (i.e., Sufyān al-Thawrī) with his chain of narration from Ibn ʿAbbās, as a _mawqūf_ (narration stopped at the companion without direct attribution to the Prophet) report with the same wording. Al-Ḥākim said, “It is authentic according to the conditions of the two Shaykhs (al-Bukhārī and Muslim), but they did not include it in their collections.” [^11]

Some scholars of Islamic cosmology claimed that the Kursī is the eighth celestial sphere—which contains the fixed stars—and above it is the ninth sphere, known as the _ether_ or the _atlas sphere_. However, others have refuted this claim.

Ibn Jarīr also narrated through the chain of Juwaybir from al-Ḥasan al-Baṣrī that he used to say, “The Kursī is the Throne.” [^12]

However, the correct view is that the Kursī is distinct from the Throne, and the Throne is greater than the Kursī, as indicated by various narrations and reports. Ibn Jarīr relied on the narration of ʿAbdullāh ibn Khalīfah from ʿUmar regarding this, though I have reservations about its authenticity. And Allāh knows best.

**“And their preservation tires Him not.”**  
— The preservation of the heavens and the earth—and all that is within and between them—does not burden or exhaust Him. Rather, it is easy for Him, effortless in His sight. He is the One who sustains every soul according to what it has earned, the Watchful over all things. Nothing escapes His knowledge, nor is anything hidden from Him. All things are insignificant, humble, and small in comparison to Him; they are in need and dependent, while He is Self-Sufficient (_al-Ghanīyy_), doing whatever He wills. He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned. He is the Subduer (_al-Qahhār_) over all things, the Reckoner (_al-Ḥasīb_) for everything, the Watchful (_ar-Raqīb_), the Most High (_al-ʿAlīyy_), the Most Great (_al-ʿAẓīm_). There is no deity worthy of worship except Him, and no Lord besides Him.

**“And He is the Most High, the Most Great.”**  
— This is similar to His words: **“And He is the Most Great, the Most Exalted.”**

As for these verses and the authentic ḥadīths with similar meanings, the best approach is that of the righteous predecessors (_as-salaf as-ṣāliḥ_): to accept them as they have come without delving into _how_ (that is, without questioning or attempting to describe their nature) and without making comparisons (_tashbīh_) to created things.

— Ibn Kathīr, _Tafsīr al-Qurʾān al-ʿAẓīm_, Surah al-Baqarah 2:255
